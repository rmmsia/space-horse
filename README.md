# space-horse

Space Horse is a Discord bot that simulates Egg Inc. rocket missions and artifact collection, except
it involves yeeting a (metaphorical) horse into space, and it brings back one artifact at a time
rather than collections of multiple artifacts like normal rocket missions in the game.

Some artifacts that are typically obtained only from crafting also drop from Space Horse missions,
but are exceedingly rare.

## Disclaimer
This project is not affiliated with Auxbrain, Inc. Nor is this reflective of actual drop rates in the Egg, Inc. game. This is only for fun.
Furthermore, it goes without saying that this does not spawn actual artifacts in your Egg, Inc. game. This bot makes zero use of your
game's Egg, Inc. ID.
