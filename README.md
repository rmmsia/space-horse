# space-horse
A small project that aims to simulate Egg Inc. rocket missions and artifact collection.
Except it involves yeeting a (metaphorical) horse into space, and it brings back one artifact at a time.
And that some craft-only artifacts can be brought back too, but are exceedingly rare instead.

This also is my first foray into object-oriented programming with Python. Sorry if it's a little messy.
